 Dist::Zilla is actually pretty easy to use once you get the toolchain
 actually installed. After you get Dist::Zilla itself installed, from
 cpan-selenium-rc-perl run `dzil authordeps | cpanm`, this will install all
 the required modules for doing a release.

Next, create a ~/.dzil/config.ini

[~/projects/cpan-selenium-rc-perl (master)↑] $ cat
~/.dzil/config.ini          
[%User]
name  = Matt Phillips
email = mattp@cpan.org

[%Rights]
license_class    = Perl_5
copyright_holder = Matt Phillips

[%PAUSE]
username = MATTP
password = password

This is for cpan uploading and subbing your name into the auto generated pod.

`dzil build`    will build the tar.gz that will be uploaded to cpan before
                release so you can inspect.
`dzil test`     runs the test suite on a build
`dzil release`  uses your config.ini to automatically upload the configured 
                build to cpan.

I believe the majority of seleniums current dist.ini is based off of David
Golden's plugin bundle:
https://metacpan.org/module/Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::DAGOLDEN You'll have to
go through to see what the individual plugins do - all in all, pretty useful
stuff.
