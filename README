NAME
    Test::WWW::Selenium - Test applications using Selenium Remote Control

VERSION
    version 1.34

SYNOPSIS
    Test::WWW::Selenium is a subclass of WWW::Selenium that provides
    convenient testing functions.

        use Test::More tests => 5;
        use Test::WWW::Selenium;

        # Parameters are passed through to WWW::Selenium
        my $sel = Test::WWW::Selenium->new( host => "localhost",
                                            port => 4444,
                                            browser => "*firefox",
                                            browser_url => "http://www.google.com",
                                            default_names => 1,
                                            error_callback => sub { ... },
                                          );

        # use special test wrappers around WWW::Selenium commands:
        $sel->open_ok("http://www.google.com", undef, "fetched G's site alright");
        $sel->type_ok( "q", "hello world");
        $sel->click_ok("btnG");
        $sel->wait_for_page_to_load_ok(5000);
        $sel->title_like(qr/Google Search/);
        $sel->error_callback(sub {...});

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a WWW::Selenium subclass providing some methods useful
    for writing tests. For each Selenium command (open, click, type, ...)
    there is a corresponding "<command>_ok" method that checks the return
    value (open_ok, click_ok, type_ok).

    For each Selenium getter (get_title, ...) there are four autogenerated
    methods ("<getter>_is", "<getter>_isnt", "<getter>_like",
    "<getter>_unlike") to check the value of the attribute.

    By calling the constructor with "default_names" set to a true value your
    tests will be given a reasonable name should you choose not to provide
    one of your own. The test name should always be the third argument.

NAME
    Test::WWW::Selenium - Test applications using Selenium Remote Control

REQUIREMENTS
    To use this module, you need to have already downloaded and started the
    Selenium Server. (The Selenium Server is a Java application.)

ADDITIONAL METHODS
    Test::WWW::Selenium also provides some other handy testing functions
    that wrap WWW::Selenium commands:

    get_location
        Returns the relative location of the current page. Works with _is,
        _like, ... methods.

    error_callback
        Sets the method to use when a corresponding selenium test is called
        and fails. For example if you call text_like(...) and it fails the
        sub defined in the error_callback will be called. This allows you to
        perform various tasks to obtain additional details that occured when
        obtianing the error. If this is set to undef then the callback will
        not be issued.

    $sel->debug()
        Starts an interactive shell to pass commands to Selenium.

        Commands are run against the selenium object, so you just need to
        type:

    eg: click("link=edit")
